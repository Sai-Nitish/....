## Assignment 1:
- C strings and C++ strings need header files
- C strings are arrays of characters whereas C++ strings are inbuilt datatypes ie string is a datatype in the C++ standard library.
- String concatenation is done with the strcat function in C whereas concatenation is done like addition with + operator.
- String copy is done with the strcpy function in C whereas copying is done with the ‘=’ operator in C++.
- C strings act on fixed size character arrays whereas C++ strings are dynamic in nature.
- C strings are generally faster,but C++ strings are more efficient(in terms of complexity).
